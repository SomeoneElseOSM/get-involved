# How to quickstart your own Docker User Group
Docker User Groups are organized by Community Leaders who are interested in talking and learning about Docker. Anyone can start a Docker User Group as long as there isn’t already a Docker User Group group in your city. We simply ask our organizers to comply with our Code of Conduct and work with them to ensure everyone in the community is feeling welcome!

## Interested in launching a Docker User Group?
Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Cr5JhcKBxugslx-ECRpMWhgj9zEIPyrECd-_KhmfKlg/) to get started and have our team reach out and create the user group on Meetup.com. Our community team would be happy to work with you on solving some of the challenges associated with organizing community events in your area.

## What are the best practices for launching a Docker Chapter Group?
- Attend similar meetups to gain experience and gauge interest in Docker
- Contact people interested in Docker to help organize and promote
- Research companies in your area willing to host an event
- Check out the calendar to find dates that don’t compete with other events
- Understand what topics interest your local audience
- Pay attention to the Meetup page aesthetics, add logos and pictures, invite members to leave comments and reply to these comments
- Promote the event on social media and invite your peers

## How does Docker, Inc support Docker Chapter Community Leaders?
- We send you some cool SWAG (t-shirts, stickers, etc)
- We promote every user group event through social channels
- We help schedule speaking engagement from Docker employees and community members when we can
- We help you connect you with other Community Leaders, local users and companies willing to host or sponsor chapter events in your area

## Are there any benefits associated with being a Docker Community Leader?
We see Docker Community Leaders as members of the Docker family. Some of the benefits from joining the Community Leaders program are:

### Exclusive content
Get scoops on new products and community management resources to help your group flourish. Join our special events and get sneak peaks of DockerCon.

### Professional growth
Develop new skills and build your reputation as a key community leader. Expand your network, learn and connect with like-minded developers.

### Community mentorship
Connect with fellow Community Leaders who can help you learn how to effectively build, manage and grow your community.

### Docker direct line
Influence what our next global events look like. Become a speaker, share your voice and help to shape our future while collaborating with the Docker team.

### Recognition
Showcase your contributions with your own profile. Be recognized as a community leader by the larger Docker community.

### Events support
Get assistance with finding the perfect speaker, social media promotion, blogging opportunities and swag for your community activity.

## How many attendees usually attend Docker User Group meetups?
Docker meetups range from 30 to 400 attendees depending on the popularity of Docker in your city and the size of the venue to accommodate the meetups.

## What’s the standard format of a Docker Chapter event?
Docker community events are usually two or three hours long and start between 4pm and 7pm. We usually have from 1 to up to 3 main talks of about 30 minutes but sometimes adjust the agenda to accommodate 10 minutes lightning talks.

## What are the typical first steps after the chapter page is live?
- Post a message on one or all of the following Docker User channels including a link to your new meetup group: Docker on Linkedin, Docker on Twitter, Slack...
- Create a Twitter handle for your group and ping @docker to get retweets
- Look for a company willing to provide the venue for the meetup
- Find a date for the first meetup that does not compete with other groups
- Look for potential speakers living in your city

## Am I allowed to use the Docker logo ?
You are allowed to use the Docker logo on the chapter group page as long as you respect our [code of conduct](https://github.com/docker/code-of-conduct). Reach out to the DevRel team to support you finding the graphic resources.

## What happens if I no longer have time to run a Docker chapter group?
We really appreciate all the contributions Docker Community Leaders make to the Docker community. Although we hope to collaborate with you in the long term, we totally understand it if you have to step down as an organizer. If that happens, just reach out and let us know whether or not you’ve found a substitute. We can help find someone who wants to step up and help organize events moving forward.

## Who should I contact if I my company wants to host / sponsor a Docker User Group event?
We are always looking for new office space to host Docker community events or new companies to sponsor food, drinks, swag or video recording. If your company is willing to sponsor a local Docker User Group, please reach out to [Alba](mailto:alba.roza@docker.com), Sr. Community Manager at Docker.

## Who should I contact if I or one my colleague wants to give a talk at a meetup?
Please fill in our [Speakers Bureau form](https://forms.gle/QSKqpngN5KGNoKw5A) and have our team reach out or contact the local Community Leaders directly.
